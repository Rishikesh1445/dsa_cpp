- Rotating Arrays
- 2 pointers - longest subarray with sum k - moving zeroes to end
- permutation logic - going from backward, swapping, reversing, check in code
2 sum - sort the array, 2 pointers on either end of array
3 sum - hashing method;
Shell Sort for merging arrays;


Mini Concepts:
- for hashing - maps always
- for uniqueness. finding elements - set(O(logn)) - uset(O(i))
- all this 2sum, 3sum, 4 sum -> sorting gives optimal solution
- XOR of similar numbers are zeroe

Remember:
- for loop checks condition for first iteration also;
- sorting pairs, p.first is seen first, if equal p.second is taken.
